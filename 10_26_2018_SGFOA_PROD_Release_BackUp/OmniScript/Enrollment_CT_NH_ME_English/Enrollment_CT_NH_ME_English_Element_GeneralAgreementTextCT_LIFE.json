The employer will be responsible for returning to individual employees any part of the payment contributed by those employees;&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">That in order for Company to accept or decline this application, all the information requested on this application must be completed. In the event the application is not complete, Company, or its designated agent(s), is authorized to obtain the necessary information and to complete that information on this application. The employer understands that the coverage issued by Company may be different than the coverage applied for herein. In that event, Company shall notify the employer of such differences, and by payment of the appropriate premiums, the employer will accept the coverage as issued;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The premium rates calculated for the employer are contingent, based upon the accuracy of the eligibility data submitted on employees and covered dependents to Company by the employer. Company reserves the right to review such rates upon receipt of all individual applications and modify the rates, if the enrollment information so warrants. Any misstatements on employees&rsquo; applications or failure to report new medical information prior to the employees&rsquo; effective dates may result in a material change to the group&rsquo;s coverage or premium rate as of the effective date of coverage;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The entire application for Group Insurance has been reviewed, and all answers contained herein are true and complete to the best of the employer&rsquo;s and/or authorized representative&rsquo;s knowledge and belief;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">All employees applying for coverage are employees of the employer, receive salary or wages documented on state and/or federal payroll reports, work full-time (unless otherwise approved by Company in writing) and meet any other eligibility requirements for coverage;</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The requested coverage is not in effect unless and until this application is approved by Company, that approval of coverage shall be evidenced by issuing insurance contracts and/or policies to the employer, and an employee&rsquo;s coverage is not in effect unless and until the employee applies and is approved for coverage by Company.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">I understand that it is a crime to knowingly provide false, incomplete or misleading information to an insurance company for the purpose of defrauding the company.
