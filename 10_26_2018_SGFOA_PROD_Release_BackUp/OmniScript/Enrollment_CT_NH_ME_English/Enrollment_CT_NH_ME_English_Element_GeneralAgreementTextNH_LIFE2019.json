If the application is not complete, Anthem reserve(s) the right to reject it and notify us in writing. We understand and agree that no coverage will be effective before the date determined by Anthem, and that such coverage will be effective only if we have paid our first month&rsquo;s premium and this application is accepted. We understand that the premium rates calculated for the employer are contingent on the accuracy of eligibility data submitted on employees and covered dependents to Anthem. Any misstatements on the employees&rsquo; applications may result in a material change to the group&rsquo;s coverage or premium rates as of the effective date of the group coverage. We further understand and agree that we should keep prior coverage in force until notified of acceptance in writing by Anthem and that no agent has the right to accept this application or bind coverage.

Rather, issuance of insurance coverage is expressly conditioned on Company&rsquo;s determination that the group is an acceptable risk based on their current underwriting practices and procedures. Unless these Conditions are met, there shall be no liability on the part of Company, except to refund the payment. The employer will be responsible for returning to individual employees any part of the payment contributed by those employees;<br /><strong>11.</strong>That in order for Company to accept or decline this application, all the information requested on this application must be completed. In the event the application is not complete, Company, or its designated agent(s), is authorized to obtain the necessary information and to complete that information on this application. The employer understands that the coverage issued by Company may be different than the coverage applied for herein. In that event, Company shall notify the employer of such differences, and by payment of the appropriate premiums, the employer will accept the coverage as issued;<br /><strong>12.</strong>The premium rates calculated for the employer are contingent, based upon the accuracy of the eligibility data submitted on employees and covered dependents to Company by the employer. Company reserves the right to review such rates upon receipt of all individual applications and modify the rates, if the enrollment information so warrants.
