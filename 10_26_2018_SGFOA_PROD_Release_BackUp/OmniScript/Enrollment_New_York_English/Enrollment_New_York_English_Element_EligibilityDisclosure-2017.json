        "text": "<p>1 Empire requires certain forms of proof to establish eligibility. See the small group guide for more details regarding eligibility categories and required forms of proof. For non-HMO products, 60% of total eligible employees must enroll, except during an annual waiver period pursuant to 45 c.f.r. 147.104. Empire reserves the right to request additional documentation to verify group size/eligibility for participation. Temporary employees; consultants; independent contractors; directors and officers who are not an owner, partner or employee; and union members covered by a union sponsored health plan are not eligible unless they meet the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in NY ins law sect. 4235(d) as amended to have the meaning of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; set forth in 42 usc 300gg-91(d)(5).</p>\n<p><br /> 2 New eligible employees include new employees and rehired employees. Newly eligible employees have 45 days from time of eligibility to enroll in coverage.</p>\n<p><br /> 3 TEFRA stands for the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982. Under TEFRA, when an employer has 20 or more full-time and/or part-time employees on its payroll for 20 weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, the group becomes the primary payer and Medicare becomes the secondary payer for the remainder of the calendar year and the following calendar year. This applies to claims of working-aged employees and their spouses age 65+ even if they go below the 20/20 threshold. The 20 weeks in a calendar year do not have to be consecutive to reach the 20/20 threshold. Employees of affiliated service groups and controlled groups of businesses should also be counted. Employers may need to consult a tax expert to determine TEFRA status.</p>\n<p><br /> Also, under OBRA (omnibus budget reconciliation act), when an employer has 100 or more full-time and/or part-time employees on its payroll for 26 weeks in a calendar year, the group becomes the primary payer and Medicare becomes the secondary payer for the remainder of the calendar year and the following calendar year for claims of actively working employees and their dependents under the age of 65 that are Medicare eligible because of a disability.</p>"
