Rather, issuance of coverage is expressly conditioned on Anthem&rsquo;s determination that the group is an acceptable risk based on their current underwriting practices and procedures. Unless these conditions are met, there shall be no liability on the part of Anthem except to refund the payment. The employer will be responsible for returning to individual.<br /><strong>11.&nbsp;</strong>That in order for Anthem to accept or decline this application, all the information requested on this application must be completed.

The employer understands that the coverage issued by Anthem may be different than the coverage applied for herein. In that event, Anthem shall notify the employer of such differences, and by payment of the appropriate premiums, the employer will accept the coverage as issued.<br /><strong>12.&nbsp;</strong>The premium rates calculated for the employer are contingent, based upon the accuracy of the eligibility data submitted on employees and covered dependents to Anthem by the employer. Anthem reserves the right to review such rates upon receipt of all individual applications for employers&rsquo; employees and to modify the rates, if the enrollment information so warrants. Any misstatements on employees&rsquo; application or failure to report new medical information prior to the employees&rsquo; effective dates may result in a material change to the groups&rsquo; coverage or premium rates as of the effective date of coverage.<br /><strong>13.&nbsp;</strong>The entire application for Group coverage has been reviewed, and all answers contained herein are true and complete to the best of the employer&rsquo;s and/or authorized representative&rsquo;s knowledge and belief.<br /><strong>14.&nbsp;</strong>All employees applying for coverage are employees of the employer and receive salary or wages documented on state and/or federal payroll reports.
