If the application is not complete, Anthem and/or HealthKeepers reserve(s) the right to reject it and notify us in writing. We understand and agree that no coverage will be effective before the date determined by Anthem and/or HealthKeepers, and that such coverage will be effective only if we have paid our first month&rsquo;s premium and this application is accepted. We understand that the premium rates calculated for the employer are contingent on the accuracy of eligibility data submitted on employees and covered dependents to Anthem and/or HealthKeepers. Any misstatements on the employees&rsquo; applications may result in a material change to the group&rsquo;s coverage or premium rates as of the effective date of the group coverage. We further understand and agree that we should keep prior coverage in force until notified of acceptance in writing by Anthem and/or HealthKeepers and that no agent has the right to accept this application or bind coverage. If this application is accepted, it becomes a part of our contract with Anthem and/or HealthKeepers. We shall comply with all provisions of the contract(s) issued.</p>\n<p>If we decide to cancel our group coverage after coverage has been issued, we understand that the cancellation will become effective on the last day of the month in which Anthem and/or HealthKeepers received the written notification of cancellation, and that no premiums will be refunded for any period between Anthem and/or HealthKeepers&rsquo; receipt of the notification and the last day of the month when the cancellation takes effect. If there are any premiums after the cancellation date, we understand that Anthem and/or HealthKeepers will refund these premiums after 45 days from the premium deposit date.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge that the terms and conditions of the coverage will be described in the group policy, and that such group policy is incorporated herein by reference as if the same were set forth in this document in full.</p>\n<p><strong>The following subsection is for Life, AD&amp;D and/or Disability Applicants:</strong></p>\n<p>The undersigned employer and/or authorized representative hereby requests that it be approved for insurance coverage through Anthem Life Insurance Company (Anthem Life). Employer understands and represents to the best of his knowledge and belief the following, and if approved for coverage, agrees by payment of the required premiums; and the authorized representative certifies on behalf of the employer:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;To comply with all terms and provisions of the Group Contract(s) issued, and trust agreements, if applicable, and also accepts enrollment under Anthem Life trust policy(ies), if applicable;<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;To make the insurance coverage available to all eligible employees and their eligible dependents and to distribute information and documents to enrolled employees as needed;<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;To maintain records and furnish to Anthem Life or their designated agent(s), any information required in connection with administration of the insurance coverage;<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;To provide notice of applicable conversion rights to eligible employees and eligible dependents;<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;That statements of medical history will be required of employees and dependents when applying for coverage within or outside the time frames or amount of coverage limits established by Anthem Life for life and disability insurance;<br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;That approval for this insurance may cancel any prior contracts and/or coverage with Anthem Life effective immediately preceding the effective date of the employer&rsquo;s coverage;<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;To pay Anthem Life by the premium due date, the premiums on behalf of each member covered under the contract, unless otherwise stated in any financial agreement between the parties, to submit applications of employees prior to their date of eligibility, to keep all necessary records regarding membership;<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;That claims filed by or on behalf of members may, at Anthem Life&rsquo;s option, be suspended if premiums are not received timely;<br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Employer will receive, on behalf of members, all notices delivered by Anthem Life, and immediately forward such notices to persons involved, at their last known address;<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;The advance premium check does not create temporary or interim insurance coverage and that receipt and deposit of that payment does not guarantee issuance of insurance coverage. Rather, issuance of insurance coverage is expressly conditioned on Anthem Life&rsquo;s determination that the group is an acceptable risk based on their current underwriting practices and procedures. Unless these Conditions are met, there shall be no liability on the part of Anthem Life, except to refund the payment. The employer will be responsible for returning to individual employees any part of the payment contributed by those employees;<br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;That in order for Anthem Life to accept or decline this application, all the information requested on this application must be completed. In the event the application is not complete, Anthem Life, or its designated agent(s), is authorized to obtain the necessary information and to complete that information on this application. The employer understands that the coverage issued by Anthem Life may be different than the coverage applied for herein. In that event, Anthem Life shall notify the employer of such differences, and by payment of the appropriate premiums, the employer will accept the coverage as issued;<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;The premium rates calculated for the employer are contingent, based upon the accuracy of the eligibility data submitted on employees and covered dependents to Anthem Life by the employer. Anthem Life reserves the right to review such rates upon receipt of all individual applications and modify the rates, if the enrollment information so warrants. Any misstatements on employees&rsquo; applications or failure to report new medical information prior to the employees&rsquo; effective dates may result in a material change to the group&rsquo;s coverage or premium rate as of the effective date of coverage;<br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;The entire application for Group Insurance has been reviewed, and all answers contained herein are true and complete to the best of the employer&rsquo;s and/or authorized representative&rsquo;s knowledge and belief;<br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;All employees applying for coverage are employees of the employer, receive salary or wages documented on state and/or federal payroll reports, work full-time (unless otherwise approved by Anthem Life in writing) and meet any other eligibility requirements for coverage;<br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;That an employee not actively at work on the policy effective date or the employee&rsquo;s eligibility date will not be covered until such employee returns to active work.<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;The requested coverage is not in effect unless and until this application is approved by Anthem Life, that approval of coverage shall be evidenced by issuing insurance contracts and/or policies to the employer, and an employee&rsquo;s coverage is not in effect unless and until the employee applies and is approved for coverage by Anthem Life.</p>"
